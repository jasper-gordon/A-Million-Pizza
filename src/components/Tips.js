  content: "Most likely it's about time or temperature. Dough is made up of a complex gluten network of proteins, think of this network like the muscles in your body. If you're too cold or you just finished excersising, your muscles will be stiff and inflexible. For best shaping, we recommend letting your dough rest in warm spot (at least 70ËšF) for at least an hour or two after shaping or coming out of the fridge.",

    label: "Why do some recipes use sugar or oil others don't?",
    content: "Coloration and texture! Sugars and fats both lend to better browning when baking. Sugar also helps yeast activation, acting as food for the bacteria. Fats help improve texture, keeping the crust from drying out too much in the oven, however it also can inhibit gltuen development so it is improtnat to beware of the amount you're putting in. ",

    label: "Do you need to precook meats before putting pizza into the oven?",

  label: "What temp is best for cooking pizza?",
  content: "As hot as you can go! Higher temperatures provide better heat transfer and faster cooking for the pizza, leading to better texture, coloration, and a better crust. Neopolitan pizza generally runs the hottest, maxing out around 950ËšF. Anything hotter and you risk your pizza tasting like fire and not much else. At home, simply prehat your oven to it's max heat.",
